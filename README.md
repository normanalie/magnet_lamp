# Magnet Lamp
## An IoT-Ready magnetic levitation lamp based on a Cults model

The 3D model: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/home/magnetic-levitating-lamp

## Hardware
To build this lamp you need:
- 3D printed parts
- 2 round Magnets
- An ESP32-C3 dev board. I've used the LuatOS one and i've modified the case for the USB-C connector.
- A MOSFET to convert 3.3V logic to 5V.
- 2 WS2812B LEDs
- A REED switch
